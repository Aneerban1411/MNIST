# MNIST
A beginner's guide to image classification.

<b>Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology(MNIST)</b> database of handwritten digits is a cult classic among beginners and due to good reason. It is learge enough for training deep neural networks and yet small enough to be managable. It is rather straight forward concept, recognize handwritten digits.

Let's have a quick overview of the data- <br>
